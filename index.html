                <p>We have been saving time, nerves and money for industrial companies since 2007, using the experience
                    of a professional team of forwarders, delivering goods anywhere in the world. ABIPA specializes in
                    one of the most strategically important areas of the logistics industry — the Russian and Baltic
                    markets. Central offices in Lithuania (Vilnius) and Russia (Moscow, Vladivostok), representative
                    offices in Latvia, Estonia, the Republic of Belarus allow you to make the most of the opportunities
                    of the largest international hub. Our clients choose air, auto, container sea and rail
                    transportation, groupage cargo, customs brokerage services and foreign trade outsourcing, which are
                    optimal for their business at a particular time. Autotransportation is a simple and well-known mode
                    of transport by land not involving railway. As industrialization advanced, freight-forwarding market
                    substantially simplified; modern types of road transport allow delivering fragile, heavy, and
                    oversized cargoes, as well as shipping goods in bulk. Road transport is most commonly used to
                    deliver cargoes to highways.</p>
                <p>Transporting goods by sea is one of the oldest logistics concepts in the world; it is optimal in
                    terms of price-quality ratio. Modern sea transportation is versatile and allowing to make the
                    delivery of multimodal cargoes a cost-effective process. Our experienced specialist will find an
                    optimal solution on sea shipping.</p>
